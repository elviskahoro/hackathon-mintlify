# Intro
Hi, I’m [Your Name], and I’m a [Your Position] at [Your Company].

# Problem
We all know that being a great coder is only part of growing your career as an engineer. These days, it’s more important than ever for engineers to create content about their work and build an audience.

Many of the best engineers are heads down, working hard, building, and making great contributions, but their talent often goes unseen because they don’t have the time or skill set to write and share about their work.

Visibility is crucial for career growth, and that’s why we created Visionary.

# Solution
Visionary helps engineers create great blog content based solely on their code.

It uses GitHub Actions to run a RAG pipeline, leveraging the PR's title, description, commit messages, and diffs to generate a blog post with Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

These blog posts help engineers communicate about their work to a broader audience and attract valuable connections, unlocking their career potential. 

# Demo
Here's a PR I made to demonstrate how Visionary works:

# Model
We’re building a suite of creator tools for engineers based solely on the code they deploy. In the future, you’ll be able to generate newsletters, social media posts, and publishing schedules, empowering any engineer to become a Visionary.
