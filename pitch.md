# Intro
- Hi, I’m [Your Name] and I’m a [Your Position] at [Your Company]

# Problem
We all know that as a developer, being a great coder is only part of having career growth. It’s more important than ever these days for engineers to be creating content about their work and engaging their audience. 

A lot of engineers are doing incredible work and building awesome things and making amazing contributions that just go unseen because they simply don’t have the time the skill sets to write and share about their work

Visibility is crucial to career growth. But who has time?

# Solution
Visionary uses GitHub Actions to run a RAG pipeline using the PR's title, description, commit messages, and diffs to generate a blog post with Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet. These blog posts will speak to/attract the attention of valuable connections in your network to help you grow in your career/build a community around you. 

# Demo 
Here's a PR I made to demonstrate how Visionary works:

# Value
With our product, an engineer doesn’t have to do anything other than just write great code in order to be seen and valued and find new opportunities.

# Model
We're building a suite of creator tools for engineers based solely on the code they deploy. In the future we'll be able to generate newsletters, social media posts, and publishing schedules.

So any engineer can become a creator and build a community around them, thereby seeing growth in their career.
